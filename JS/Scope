SCOPE

ex-1
var name="vinay"

if(name==="vinay")
{
var department="engg";
}

console.log(name);//vinay
console.log(department);//engg

Note:value of departement is present outside the block, As js does not create scope for blocks, js is function scope but new feature
allow us to define block scope.


ES6 feature:In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope,
            which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.
            
            
Ex-2
var top=10;
var inner=50;
function foo(){
  var inner=20;
  console.log(inner);
}

foo();//20
console.log(inner)//50;


ex-3
var name="vinay"
function foo(name){
     console.log(name);
}
foo("raj");//raj

PROTOTYPE
Starting with basics, there are following data types in JavaScript:

undefined
null
number
string
boolean
object

First five are primitive data types. These store a value of their type such as a boolean, and can be true or false.

The last “object” is a reference type which we can describe as a collection of key-value pairs (but it is much more).

In JavaScript, new objects are made using Object constructor function (or object literal {}) which provides generic methods
like toString() and valueOf().




ex-
var obj=new Employee();
1)a new memory will be created

BINDING IN JS
https://gist.github.com/zcaceres/2a4ac91f9f42ec0ef9cd0d18e4e71262#default-binding


var y={
    name:"vinay",
    age:"24"
};
var fun=function foo(){
    this.zzz=8;
console.log(this.name);
console.log(this.age);
console.log(this);
}
var bind=fun.bind(y);
bind();
